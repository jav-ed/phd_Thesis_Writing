  abstract = {AdaBoost is one of the most excellent Boosting algorithms. It has a solid theoretical basis and has made great success in practical applications. AdaBoost can boost a weak learning algorithm with an accuracy slightly better than random guessing into an arbitrarily accurate strong learning algorithm, bringing about a new method and a new design idea to the design of learning algorithm. This paper first introduces how Boosting, just a conjecture when proposed, was proved right, and how this proof led to the origin of AdaBoost algorithm. Second, training and generalization error of AdaBoost are analyzed to explain why AdaBoost can successfully improve the accuracy of a weak learning algorithm. Third, different theoretical models to analyze AdaBoost are given. Meanwhile, many variants derived from these models are presented. Fourth, extensions of binary-class AdaBoost to multiclass AdaBoost are described. Besides, applications of AdaBoost algorithm are also introduced. Finally, interested directions which need to be further studied are discussed. For Boosting theory, these directions include deducing a tighter generalization error bound and finding a more precise weak learning condition in multiclass problem. For AdaBoost, the stopping conditions, the way to enhance anti-noise capability and how to improve the accuracy by optimizing the diversity of the base classifiers, are good questions to be in-depth researched.},

  abstract = {It is shown that in certain types of dynamical systems it is possible to have attractors which are strange but not chaotic. Here we use the word strange to refer to the geometry or shape of the attracting set, while the word chaotic refers to the dynamics of orbits on the attractor (in particular, the exponential divergence of nearby trajectories). We first give examples for which it can be demonstrated that there is a strange nonchaotic attractor. These examples apply to a class of maps which model nonlinear oscillators (continuous time) which are externally driven at two incommensurate frequencies. It is then shown that such attractore are persistent under perturbations which preserve the original system type (i.e., there are two incommensurate external driving frequencies). This suggests that, for systems of the typw which we have considered, nonchaotic strange attractors may be expected to occur for a finite interval of parameter values. On the other hand, when small perturbations which do not preserve the system type are numerically introduced the strange nonchaotic attractor is observed to be converted to a periodic or chaotic orbit. Thus we conjecture that, in general, continuous time systems (“flows”) which are not externally driven at two incommensurate frequencies should not be expected to have strange nonchaotic attractors except possibly on a set of measure zero in the parameter space.},

  abstract  = {The only implicit smoothing method implemented in the DLR Flow Solver TAU is the LU-SGS method. It was chosen several years ago because of its low memory requirements and low operation counts. Since in the past for many examples a severe restriction of the CFL number and loss of robustness was observed, it is the goal of this paper to revisit the LU-SGS implementation and to discuss several alternative implicit smoothing strategies used within an agglomeration multigrid for unstructured meshes. Starting point is a full implicit multistage Runge-Kutta method. Based on this method we develop and suggest several additional features and simplifications such that the implicit method is applicable to high Reynolds number viscous flows, that is the required matrices fit into the fast memory of our cluster hardware and the arising linear systems can be approximately solved efficiently. To this end we focus on simplifications of the Jacobian as well as efficient iterative approximate solution methods. To significantly improve the approximate linear solution methods we take care of grid anisotropy for both approximately solving the linear systems and agglomeration strategy. The procedure creating coarse grid meshes is extended by strategies identifying structured parts of the mesh. This seems to improve the quality of coarse grid meshes in the way that an overall better reliability of multigrid can be observed. Furthermore we exploit grid information within the iterative solution methods for the linear systems. Numerical examples demonstrate the gain with respect to reliability and efficiency.},

Both experimental and theoretical results are presented concerning the dynamic elastic-plastic behaviour of cantilever pipes subjected to a transverse force pulse at the free end. Comparisons between experimental data and theoretical predictions are made for mild-steel pipes with outer diameter-to-thickness ratios of 19.5, 28 and 32. It is demonstrated that, for these geometries, the whipping pipes display three characteristically different responses, viz. elastic, plastic hardening behaviour for thick pipes, elastic, plastic hardening-softening behaviour for moderately thick pipes and elastic, plastic hardening-softening-collapse behaviour for thinner pipes. The experimental data taken from a series of high-speed films are compared with the predictions of the instantaneous shapes of the whipping pipes derived from both a rigid, perfectly-plastic, large deflection, dynamic beam model and a more comprehensive model which incorporates the effects of elasticity and plastic hardening and softening, the details of which are presented in the paper.},

A pipeline is supported across a span, is fully clamped at both ends and is struck at the mid-span and at the one-quarter span positions. Most of the pipelines are pressurised with a nitrogen gas. The initial impact energy produces large inelastic ductile deformations of the pipeline and, in some cases, failure. A method is introduced which idealises a deformed pipeline cross-section in order to estimate the local and global components of the total displacement from experimental measurements of the final cross-section. Comparisons are also made with several previously published experimental studies for which sufficient data are available to make the calculations. A clearer insight into pipeline behaviour is achieved than is possible only with values of the maximum permanent transverse displacements which have been reported in previous experimental studies. This information should assist with pipeline design, provide more rigorous validation for numerical schemes and contribute to a better understanding of pipeline failure. Recommendations are made on the accuracy and suitability of some well known empirical equations for predicting the permanent deformations of pressurised and empty pipelines caused by large rigid masses, relative to the pipeline mass, travelling with low initial impact velocities up to about 15m/s.},

  abstract       = {The hydrogen storage tank is a key parameter of the hydrogen storage system in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), as its safety determines the commercialization of HFCVs. Compared with other types, the type IV hydrogen storage tank which consists of a polymer liner has the advantages of low cost, lightweight, and low storage energy consumption, but meanwhile, higher hydrogen permeability. A detailed review of the existing research on hydrogen permeability of the liner material of type IV hydrogen storage tanks can improve the understanding of the hydrogen permeation mechanism and provide references for following-up researchers and research on the safety of HFCVs. The process of hydrogen permeation and test methods are firstly discussed in detail. This paper then analyzes the factors that affect the process of hydrogen permeation and the barrier mechanism of the liner material and summarizes the prediction models of gas permeation. In addition to the above analysis and comments, future research on the permeability of the liner material of the type IV hydrogen storage tank is prospected.},

  eprintclass = {astro-ph.GA},
  eprinttype  = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {We present a new semi-analytic formalism for modeling metal absorption lines that emerge from a clumpy galactic environment, ALPACA. We predict the ''down-the-barrel'' (DTB) metal absorption line profiles and the EW of absorption at different impact parameters as a function of the properties of the clumps, including the clump kinematics, the clump volume filling factor, the clump number density profile and the clump ion column densities. With ALPACA, we jointly model the stacked DTB CII$\lambda$1334 spectrum of a sample of $z \sim$ 3 Lyman break galaxies and the EW v.s. $b$ profile of a sample of $z \sim$ 2 star-forming galaxy-galaxy pairs. ALPACA successfully reproduced two datasets simultaneously, and the best-fit prefers a low clump volume filling factor ($\sim 3 \times 10^{-3}$). The radial velocities of the clumps are a superposition of a rapidly accelerated outflow with a maximum velocity of $\sim 400\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ and a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm cl} \sim\,120 \rm km\,s^{-1}$. The joint modeling reveals a physical scenario where the absorption observed at a particular velocity is contributed by the clumps distributed over a fairly broad range of radii. We also find that the commonly adopted Sobolev approximation is at best only applicable within a narrow range of radii where the clumps are undergoing rapid acceleration in a non-volume-filling clumpy medium. Lastly, we find that the clump radial velocity profile may not be fully constrained by the joint modeling and spatially-resolved Ly$\alpha$ emission modeling may help break the degeneracy.},

  abstract    = {Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model PaLM. We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.},

The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of Gemini models in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases and we discuss our approach toward deploying them responsibly to users.},

The largest model, Falcon-180B, has been trained on over 3.5 trillion tokens of text--the largest openly documented pretraining run. Falcon-180B significantly outperforms models such as PaLM or Chinchilla, and improves upon concurrently developed models such as LLaMA 2 or Inflection-1. It nears the performance of PaLM-2-Large at a reduced pretraining and inference cost, making it, to our knowledge, one of the three best language models in the world along with GPT-4 and PaLM-2-Large. We report detailed evaluations, as well as a deep dive into the methods and custom tooling employed to pretrain Falcon. Notably, we report on our custom distributed training codebase, allowing us to efficiently pretrain these models on up to 4,096 A100s on cloud AWS infrastructure with limited interconnect. We release a 600B tokens extract of our web dataset, as well as the Falcon-7/40/180B models under a permissive license to foster open-science and accelerate the development of an open ecosystem of large language models.},

  abstract    = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have drawn a lot of attention due to their strong performance on a wide range of natural language tasks, since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. LLMs' ability of general-purpose language understanding and generation is acquired by training billions of model's parameters on massive amounts of text data, as predicted by scaling laws \cite{kaplan2020scaling,hoffmann2022training}. The research area of LLMs, while very recent, is evolving rapidly in many different ways. In this paper, we review some of the most prominent LLMs, including three popular LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, PaLM), and discuss their characteristics, contributions and limitations. We also give an overview of techniques developed to build, and augment LLMs. We then survey popular datasets prepared for LLM training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, review widely used LLM evaluation metrics, and compare the performance of several popular LLMs on a set of representative benchmarks. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing open challenges and future research directions.},

  abstract    = {Due to its many applications, \emph{curve simplification} is a long-studied problem in computational geometry and adjacent disciplines, such as graphics, geographical information science, etc. Given a polygonal curve $P$ with $n$ vertices, the goal is to find another polygonal curve $P'$ with a smaller number of vertices such that $P'$ is sufficiently similar to $P$. Quality guarantees of a simplification are usually given in a \emph{local} sense, bounding the distance between a shortcut and its corresponding section of the curve. In this work, we aim to provide a systematic overview of curve simplification problems under \emph{global} distance measures that bound the distance between $P$ and $P'$. We consider six different curve distance measures: three variants of the \emph{Hausdorff} distance and three variants of the \emph{Fr\'echet} distance. And we study different restrictions on the choice of vertices for $P'$. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for some variants of the global curve simplification problem and show NP-hardness for other variants. Through this systematic study we observe, for the first time, some surprising patterns, and suggest directions for future research in this important area.},

  abstract    = {Token-based text-to-speech (TTS) models have emerged as a promising avenue for generating natural and realistic speech, yet they grapple with low pronunciation accuracy, speaking style and timbre inconsistency, and a substantial need for diverse training data. In response, we introduce a novel hierarchical acoustic modeling approach complemented by a tailored data augmentation strategy and train it on the combination of real and synthetic data, scaling the data size up to 650k hours, leading to the zero-shot TTS model with 0.8B parameters. Specifically, our method incorporates a latent variable sequence containing supplementary acoustic information based on refined self-supervised learning (SSL) discrete units into the TTS model by a predictor. This significantly mitigates pronunciation errors and style mutations in synthesized speech. During training, we strategically replace and duplicate segments of the data to enhance timbre uniformity. Moreover, a pretrained few-shot voice conversion model is utilized to generate a plethora of voices with identical content yet varied timbres. This facilitates the explicit learning of utterance-level one-to-many mappings, enriching speech diversity and also ensuring consistency in timbre. Comparative experiments (Demo page: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/ham-tts/)demonstrate our model's superiority over VALL-E in pronunciation precision and maintaining speaking style, as well as timbre continuity.},

PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},

  abstract    = {In this paper, we describe a lightweight Python framework that provides integrated learning and verification of neural Lyapunov functions for stability analysis. The proposed tool, named LyZNet, learns neural Lyapunov functions using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve Zubov's equation and verifies them using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers. What distinguishes this tool from others in the literature is its ability to provide verified regions of attraction close to the domain of attraction. This is achieved by encoding Zubov's partial differential equation (PDE) into the PINN approach. By embracing the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problems, we demonstrate that in cases where convex optimization, such as semidefinite programming, fails to capture the domain of attraction, our neural network framework proves more successful. The tool also offers automatic decomposition of coupled nonlinear systems into a network of low-dimensional subsystems for compositional verification. We illustrate the tool's usage and effectiveness with several numerical examples, including both non-trivial low-dimensional nonlinear systems and high-dimensional systems. The repository of the tool can be found at https://git.uwaterloo.ca/hybrid-systems-lab/lyznet.},
