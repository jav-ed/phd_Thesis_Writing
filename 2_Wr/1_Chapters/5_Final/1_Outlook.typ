= Conclusion and Outlook <chap_7>

1. compare beam optimiaztion with fem optimiaztion
2. more work required to develop standards and certifaction rules for #glspl("swith")
3. cooloaborative work on a open source #gls("fem") #gls("swith") model 
4. research on #glspl("swith") is very sparse - more researcher should be motivated to contribute (frorm the best knowledge of the authot, this is the first phd written about #glspl("swith"))
  1. numiercal simulations
  2. experiemntal tests
5. adding more optimization cases than presetned in @chap_5
6. a pathway for conducitng structral tests with hydorgen was suggested in 
7. developing computational methods to investigate which #gls("lie") generated constraitning forces mentioned in @chap_3_0_4
8. based on these reuslts see which methods are avialable to reduce or even remove these constraint forces
9. conduct investigations wheter #glspl("swith") are actually superiori to aircrafts where hydrogen tnaks can simply be placed in there
