// ------------------------------ final results ----------------------------- //
// exokain which lie was chosen and why -> selected collets 
// note some of the statements made below were before the plotting codes were modifed
// give an reason why you selected collets - say one side open collets as mentioend  in @ 

for the ongoing work we will assume that we will use collets.
// this was based on the demand of having enough free visible area such that optical devices can be used.
// furthermore they can be obtained easily, the IMA has high experince with their application
// the knowledge of already carried out optimiaztions for the IMA was included in thsi decision.
// finally the one side open collet reduces the risk of constraint forces
// inspired from these real world experince, the collets is chosenm. therefore in the figure it will be called collet placing.
// yet, again, one of the main objetive of the optimiaztion is to answer questions, which could lead to another gls("lie") than the collet.
// therefore, combining the reasonong provided in @ and the otucome here in the optimiaztion with your project specifix requirements, another #gls("lie") could be selected.
