// what expected to see here and why
the colloboration with IMA helped to find some real world demands. Based on these findings, the found demands shall be provided as the formualtion of optimization probelems. The optiiaztion formaulaiton shall be provided, explained, solved and 
// maybe add, also interpreted when required
depcited.
Moreover, based on the multiple optimization problem defintions the flexibility of the presented approach can be seen.


// --------------------------------- opti A --------------------------------- //
lets start with the first optimization model. The objective fucntion is given in
// @


// explain design vars, bounds, constraints

// explain beam model boundary coniditons


// shows results of optimiaztion

// interpret the results 

// give an reason why you selected collets - say one side open collets as mentioend  in @ 

for the ongoing work we will assume that we 
// this was based on the demand of having enough free visible area such that optical devices can be used.
// furthermore they can be obtained easily, the IMA has high experince with their application
// the knowledge of already carried out optimiaztions for the IMA was included in thsi decision.
// finally the one side open collet reduces the risk of constraint forces
// inspired from these real world experince, the collets is chosenm. therefore in the figure it will be called collet placing.
// yet, again, one of the main objetive of the optimiaztion is to answer questions, which could lead to another gls("lie") than the collet.
// therefore, combining the reasonong provided in @ and the otucome here in the optimiaztion with your project specifix requirements, another #gls("lie") could be selected.


// --------------------------------- opti B --------------------------------- //
// now introduce that this is the next optiiaztion model that could have releveance for real world application
// explain why 

// beam model 
// results + interpret
