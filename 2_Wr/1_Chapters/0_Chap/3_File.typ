== Novelty and Significance of this work <chap_0_5>
In this section the value of this work shall be highlighted.
For that it shall be explained which main goal the developement of #gl_("swith", pl:true) follows.
Next, which benefits reader could get going through this thesis.
Afterwards it shall be hihglighted which concrete benefits especially the industry could gain thorugh the proposed optimization framework.
Finally, besides the direct beenfits, the indirect beenfits shall be mentioned.
It also shall be explained why these indirect points are of value.

The main problem that #gl_("swith", pl:true) tries to solve or at least to reduce is the negative impact of the aviation on the climate crisis. 
Since #gl_("swith", pl:true) are pwoered by hydrogen, it is possible to keep aircraft, while having no or a reduced impact on the environment.
In order to grasph how important the aviation is, the reader can get some arguments for its neccisity in @chap_0_2.

the potential applicability of existing standards from various domains, including
aerospace and automotive, to #gl_("swith") for a potential future certification process of to #gl_("swith", pl:true)  were given.
It was highlighted the associated challenges and uncertainties, acknowledging the absence of a single, all-
encompassing standard for #gl_("swith").  
Due the latter, alternatives solutions were identified. The limitaiton of the proposed alternative werealso mentioned clearly. These findings could support certification institutions to come up with the currenlty missing standard that is valid for #gl_("swith", pl:true).

it was explained how the maximum nominal working pressure for high-pressure tanks intended for burst tests could be found.
Our findings revealed a current upper limit of 525 bar, imposed by the limitations of existing test
facilities. The study underscored that these standards should serve as flexible guiding frameworks
rather than rigid protocols, encouraging progressive development of #gl_("swith", pl:true)

the reader is introduced to general properties of hydrogen. Followed by a detailed exploration of the potential hazards associated with its use, substantiated with experimental and simulation results. Key factors that can trigger risks, such as ignition and detonation, are identified and methods to avoid these
situations are included. 
Subsequently, a detailed roadmap with two primary objectives is
proposed: to enable the conduction of experimental tests on hydrogen #gl_("swith", pl:true) at scales
equivalent to large aircraft for their certification. 
Secondly, to advance simulation techniques to a
point where they can replace most costly experimental tests and offer sufficient accuracy for
SWITH certification. This roadmap includes a series of smaller-scale experimental and numerical
studies. The findings affirms hydrogen's safe usage in aviation if responsibly managed, but
advises against direct large-scale experimental testing on #gl_("swith", pl:true) due to current knowledge and technology limitations.




 alternative standards that are best suited for

Aviation has become an indispensable part of global economy. Its importance is evident in
the private sector, where it is connecting destinations worldwide and in the business sector,
where goods are transported and business trips are undertaken. Since an aircraft burns fuel
and thus emits carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) its
impact on the environment is significant and cannot be neglected. Emissions are so high that
the European commission has formulated a document called Flightpath 2050, where it defines
two of its goals to be reduction of CO2 and NOx emission by 75% per passenger kilometer
and 90%, respectively. Currently, commercial aviation is responsible for around 3.5 % of the
global carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission [17] and it can be assumed that in an
increasingly globalized world the demand for fast and convenient mobility will not diminish.
Industry and governments around the world realized that taking active steps towards a cleaner
flying are essential for saving the planet earth. In 2010, the international Civil Aviation Or-
ganization (ICAO) formulated industry-wide goals for reducing carbon emissions. These
goals can be summarized by 2 main objectives, to establish carbon-neutral growth beyond
year 2020 and to further reduce carbon emissions to half of the current level by the year 2050.

The focus of this work is on science. Yet, science needs financial sponsoring to be carried out properly.
The nation that is able to showcase it's ability to fund the science on such a new, promising and complex endeavour gains many benefits. 
First of all, it is generally assumed that top science would be highly linked to the overall progress of a nation.
The progress of a nation is encapsulates a wide meaning. 
It would capture aspects like living standards, storing wealth in a country, reliability to invest wealth, personal freedom

Among them are, more scientists are attacted for doing research in this nation.
The overall image for foreign governments, industries and scientific centres is improved.
The latter helps to build trust and consequently opens other doors.
Besides the assumigly strong economically benefit, local residents could argue, their govement would care about the current climate cirsis.
If the image on the global scale becomes better and the local residents
