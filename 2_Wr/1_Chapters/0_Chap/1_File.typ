== Research Objectives <chap_0_3>
This section outlines the overall content to be covered in this work, guided by the thesis title: #emph([Investigations on Aircraft #gl_("swith", long:true)]). Building upon the fundamental understanding of #gl_("swith") established in @chap_0_2, we acknowledge the vast scope of research required in this field. The term "investigations" is particularly significant, as the breadth of research necessary for #gl_("swith") extends far beyond what a single researcher or even a single academic department could fully explore.
Nevertheless, initial steps towards realizing a commercially viable #gl_("swith") are not only essential but also increasingly valuable due to their pioneering nature. 
These early investigations could lay the groundwork for future advancements and offer unique insights into this innovative technology.
The concrete topics to be covered in this research are as follows:

/* ---------------------------------- intro --------------------------------- */
One primary objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the #gl_("swith") concept. This involves precisely defining what a #gl_("swith") is, exploring its potential applications in aviation and elucidating its crucial relationship with hydrogen as the fuel. 
The study should evaluate the benefits that #gl_("swith") technology could bring to aircraft aviation and environment. 
Following this, the research needs to conduct a analysis of the current state of the art in #gl_("swith", pl:true), reviewing existing literature, patents, and ongoing research projects to identify key advancements, challenges, and trends in the field. 

/* ---------------------------------- norms --------------------------------- */
Another critical objective is to examine the regulatory landscape for #gl_("swith", pl:true). This includes investigating the current processes and requirements for licensing #gl_("swith") technology and analyzing the steps necessary to make #gl_("swith", pl:true) available for daily commercial deployment. 
The research should identify current limitations in the regulatory framework and propose potential solutions to overcome these barriers. 
For that a key goal is to determine critical load cases for a #gl_("swith") certification. 
This involves the identification and prioritization of load cases that are most likely to be scrutinized in the certification process.
In case of non-existing regulations for #gl_("swith") certification, this work could thereby contribute to the eventual certification and implementation of this innovative technology in commercial aviation.

/* -------------------------------- hydrogen -------------------------------- */
Given the critical role of hydrogen in #gl_("swith", pl:true), a comprehensive introduction to hydrogen and its properties is essential to this research. 
The study should focus particularly on the unique characteristics of hydrogen that pose challenges in its real-world application. 
A key objective is to investigate whether hydrogen can be safely and effectively used in experimental investigations of #gl_("swith", pl:true). 
This research aims to design and analyze potential experimental setups based on the critical load cases identified earlier, with the goal of maximizing the relevance of these experiments to certification institutions. 
These experimental investigations can be crucial in demonstrating the viability and safety of #gl_("swith") technology to regulatory bodies. 
Furthermore, the study needs explore whether certain potentially dangerous properties of hydrogen can be safely disregarded in experimental structural verification of #gl_("swith", pl:true) without compromising the integrity or validity of the tests. 
This analysis is vital for developing safe, practical, and cost-effective testing protocols that can contribute to the eventual certification process for #gl_("swith") technology in commercial aviation.

/* ---------------------- curvature, impact fill medium --------------------- */
Should the research determine that hydrogen is not suitable as a filling agent for experimental investigations, a thorough justification for this conclusion needs to be provided. The study should then focus on identifying and evaluating alternative filling agents that could be used in place of hydrogen. 
This evaluation should consider several crucial aspects. 
Firstly, the safety profile of potential alternative agents needs to be assessed, taking into account any properties that could pose risks to personnel, the environment, or the #gl_("swith") structure itself. 
Secondly, the technical readiness of working with these alternative media should be examined, ensuring that sufficient experience and technological advancements exist to guarantee secure working conditions. 
A key objective of this research is to investigate the structural implications of replacing hydrogen with an alternative filling agent. 
This investigation needs to analyze how such a substitution might alter the structural behavior of the #gl_("swith"). To ensure the validity and reliability of these findings, the research should support all suggestions and conclusions with either comprehensive literature reviews or numerical simulations. 
This approach is supposed to provide a solid foundation for understanding the consequences of using alternative filling agents in experimental investigations in #gl_("swith", pl:true) and their potential impact on the overall performance and safety of the system.


/* ------------------------- load introduction study ------------------------ */
After identifying critical load cases for potential certification and selecting an appropriate filling agent, shifting the focus to load application methods is demanded.
This study should investigate various options available for physically applying forces to the #gl_("swith") within a potential structure verification process. A comprehensive exploration of load transfer methods needs to be conducted, identifying a range of techniques that could be employed in experimental settings. 
Once these methods are identified, they need to be assessed based on reasonable criteria. The selection of these criteria should demonstrate the author's understanding of real-world demands and realizability limitations in structural testing. 
Based on this evaluation, if feasible, a preferred method for physically introducing forces into the #gl_("swith") should be recommended. This recommendation needs to be well-justified, taking into account the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of #gl_("swith", pl:true) structural verification.
