== Novelty and Significance of this work <chap_0_5>
Aviation has become an indispensable part of global economy. Its importance is evident in
the private sector, where it is connecting destinations worldwide and in the business sector,
where goods are transported and business trips are undertaken. Since an aircraft burns fuel
and thus emits carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) its
impact on the environment is significant and cannot be neglected. Emissions are so high that
the European commission has formulated a document called Flightpath 2050, where it defines
two of its goals to be reduction of CO2 and NOx emission by 75% per passenger kilometer
and 90%, respectively. Currently, commercial aviation is responsible for around 3.5 % of the
global carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission [17] and it can be assumed that in an
increasingly globalized world the demand for fast and convenient mobility will not diminish.
Industry and governments around the world realized that taking active steps towards a cleaner
flying are essential for saving the planet earth. In 2010, the international Civil Aviation Or-
ganization (ICAO) formulated industry-wide goals for reducing carbon emissions. These
goals can be summarized by 2 main objectives, to establish carbon-neutral growth beyond
year 2020 and to further reduce carbon emissions to half of the current level by the year 2050.

1. Scientific Leadership and Innovation:
   - By investing in cutting-edge research like #gl_("swith") technology, a nation could enhance its position in scientific innovation.
   - This potential leadership role might attract talented scientists and researchers from around the world, possibly creating a virtuous cycle of knowledge creation and intellectual capital accumulation.

2. Economic Benefits:
   - Advanced research often has the potential to lead to patentable technologies and spin-off industries, which could generate economic returns.
   - The development of expertise in hydrogen technologies and innovative aircraft design might open opportunities for contracts and partnerships with aerospace companies and other nations.

3. Geopolitical Influence:
   - Demonstrating technological prowess in critical areas like sustainable aviation could potentially enhance a nation's soft power and diplomatic leverage.
   - Leadership in green technologies may contribute to improving a country's global image and influence in international climate negotiations.

4. Environmental Stewardship:
   - By actively pursuing solutions to reduce aviation's carbon footprint, a nation can demonstrate its commitment to addressing climate change.
   - This approach might boost public support both domestically and internationally, as citizens increasingly prioritize environmental concerns.

5. Educational and Workforce Development:
   - Research programs of this nature have the potential to stimulate interest in STEM fields among students, possibly helping to cultivate the next generation of scientists and engineers.
   - The skills and knowledge developed through such research could have spillover effects, potentially benefiting other sectors of the economy.

6. International Collaboration:
   - Pioneering research may create opportunities for international scientific collaboration, potentially fostering diplomatic ties and knowledge exchange.
   - Such collaborations could lead to shared resources, reduced costs, and accelerated progress in addressing global challenges.

7. National Security and Energy Independence:
   - Advancements in hydrogen technology might contribute to energy diversification and potentially reduce dependence on fossil fuels, possibly enhancing national security.
   - The dual-use nature of aerospace technologies could have implications for defense capabilities.

8. Public Perception and National Pride:
   - High-profile scientific achievements have the potential to boost national morale and foster a sense of pride among citizens.
   - This could translate into broader support for science funding and evidence-based policymaking.


In conclusion, while the primary goal of this research is to advance our scientific understanding of #gl_("swith") technology and its potential for sustainable aviation, the broader implications of such research may extend far beyond the laboratory. Nations that invest in this type of pioneering work could position themselves to reap multifaceted benefits spanning economic, geopolitical, environmental, and social domains. As we delve deeper into the technical aspects of #gl_("swith") in subsequent chapters, it's important to keep in mind this broader context and the potential transformative impact this research might have on both the sponsoring nation and the global community.

The focus of this work is on science. Yet, science needs financial sponsoring to be carried out properly.
The nation that is able to showcase it's ability to fund the science on such a new, promising and complex endeavour gains many benefits. 
First of all, it is generally assumed that top science would be highly linked to the overall progress of a nation.
The progress of a nation is encapsulates a wide meaning. 
It would capture aspects like living standards, storing wealth in a country, reliability to invest wealth, personal freedom

Among them are, more scientists are attacted for doing research in this nation.
The overall image for foreign governments, industries and scientific centres is improved.
The latter helps to build trust and consequently opens other doors.
Besides the assumigly strong economically benefit, local residents could argue, their govement would care about the current climate cirsis.
If the image on the global scale becomes better and the local residents
