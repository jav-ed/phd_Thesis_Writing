=== II.7 Filtering Essential Standards

In the previous section, an overview of standards from various areas that use compressed hydrogen as fuel was given. This segment should summarize which superordinate categories of hydrogen applications exist and how the application in K2H2 is to be classified. Then, criteria for filtering the essential standards from the many possible standards should be named and applied. The results will be used for the following steps. Furthermore, general important aspects of the chosen standards should be highlighted. Finally, safety factors for the burst test and maximum possible nominal pressures will be recorded.

The three superordinate categories in Table 16 allow, with experienced handling of standards, a quick first assessment of their applicability. Within Table 16, various combinations can be chosen. Thus, it would be possible to choose mobile, Type I and air, as well as mobile, Type I and ground. Due to the numerous combination possibilities, the standard must be carefully selected to cover the requirement profile as precisely as possible.

Table 16: Superordinate tank application requirements for finding standards

| Storage | Tank Type | Locality |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Stationary | I | Underwater |
| Mobile | II | Underground |
| | III | Ground |
| | IV | Air |
| | V | |

The choice for K2H2 is mobile, Type IV and air. It is to be expected that this selection should also hold for larger aircraft. Mobile and air are to be seen as constants. The Type IV is significantly lighter than Type I, II and III. Against tank type V, on the one hand, is its price and on the other hand the limited availability. If these factors do not change, tank type IV can also be used for large aircraft. It follows that the results from K2H2 could also represent added value for large aircraft manufacturers.

The criteria by which the essential standards are to be determined are given in Table 17. The order of the listing does not follow any weighting. The actuality springs from the idea that the closer the publication is in time, the higher the probability that more knowledge from expert teams could be integrated. Standards are often revised precisely for this reason. When new findings become available, these can be seen as potential new requirements. The goal of the standard publishers is always to ensure safety and functionality for humans and the environment and to minimize existing gaps. It would also be conceivable that existing requirements must be removed or adapted.

[Table 17 with criteria for selecting essential standards is included here]

The point active further development from Table 17 follows on from the previous one. Among other things, due to technological progress and existing climate damage, it should be of decisive importance for publishers of standards to continuously adapt standards. This way, they can ensure that their standards keep pace with temporal changes, effectively steer in a positive direction, and consequently remain relevant.


The third point, accessibility, from Table 17, is an extremely important criterion, as even excellent standards have no value for research and industry if they cannot be obtained. Points 4-6 indicate experience and successful implementation. The more frequently a standard is used and functional vehicles can be constructed and approved, the more trustworthy this standard becomes. If a standard enjoys a trustworthy reputation, it can generally be assumed that the standard is internationally recognized. Europe-wide recognition becomes important when no standards can be found that have been able to acquire high international esteem. In this case, outside of Germany, the European area would be the next possible larger target group. Costs are particularly important for start-ups, small and medium-sized research and industry institutes. The last point is to ensure that the standard fulfills the requirements of K2H2 to a certain extent. Understandably, any standard that does not consider the mentioned point would be completely excluded.

In K2H2, three standards could be found that fulfill all criteria and complement each other. These are listed in Table 18. Mandatory and optional tests from ISO 11119-3:2020 are given as an example in Tables 19 and 20.

Table 18: Selection of the 3 essential standards for K2H2
1) EC 406/2010
2) ISO 19881:2018
3) ISO 11119-3:2020

[Tables 19 and 20 with mandatory and optional tests from ISO 11119-3:2020 are included here]

Next, important points of selected standards should be addressed. The EC 406/2010 and ISO 19881:2018 are established regulations for the automotive industry. The EC 406/2010 is available in several languages and valid for 50 geopolitical regions (islands and countries). Nevertheless, there are some objections to direct application to aviation. First, the full title in English reads COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 406/2010 of 26 April 2010 implementing Regulation (EC) No 79/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on type-approval of hydrogen-powered motor vehicles. A vehicle is a vehicle. By definition, an aircraft is also a vehicle. However, if the German translation of EC 406/2010 is read, the word vehicle is translated as motor vehicle. This limits the applications to road vehicles. In other words, from the title definition in the English version itself, it is not clearly evident whether aviation use would be legally permissible. In the title of ISO 19881:2018, the restriction to road-bound vehicles is unambiguously underlined: Gaseous hydrogen - Land vehicle fuel containers.

Secondly, ISO 19881:2018 is limited to tanks that are permanently connected to the vehicle. Thirdly, more than one test object is required for some tests. For example, ISO-11119-3, paragraph 8.2.1 states: "A minimum of 30 cylinders of the new design shall be made available for prototype testing". For K2H2, due to the innovation, only a single wing is available for experimental investigations. Fourth, some prescribed requirements in EC 406/2010 and ISO 19881:2018, which are identical, could be too high for practical application. As an example, the criteria for the burst ratio with gaseous hydrogen from Table IV.3.6. (EC 406/2010) and 7.3.2 (ISO 19881:2018) are mentioned. The burst ratio is given in equation (3). The variables pburst, factor and pwnp are referred to as the minimum burst pressure, a factor dependent on the fiber material and as nominal operating pressure.

pburst ≥ factor · pwnp (3)

For glass, aramid and carbon, the factors are 3.5, 3.0 and 2.25. It follows that when using glass as fiber material, the hydrogen tank must be able to withstand three times the nominal pressure. If the nominal pressure for the K2H2 tank were set at 300 bar, the tank would have to withstand at least 900 bar. The high safety factors defined in EC 406/2010 and ISO 19881:2018 are technically very demanding. The higher the safety factors, the more material is needed to meet said requirements. More material means more mass and thus more weight. This is highly undesirable in aviation. Furthermore, the high-pressure gas tank test facility of the European (GasTeF) in [9] states that it can test with a maximum internal pressure of 1050 bar. Depending on the fiber material, maximum working nominal pressures pmwnp between 300 and 465 bar can be achieved. However, if the factors of ISO 11119-3:2020 are observed, maximum working nominal pressures pmwnp between 437.5 and 525 bar are to be expected. The complete list of fiber material-dependent safety factors of both standards can be found in the denominator of the fractions in Table 21. The maximum possible operating pressures, with a maximum test pressure of 1050 bar [9], depending on fiber material and standard, are also given in Table 21.

Table 21: Fiber material-dependent safety factors (in the denominator of the fractions) and associated maximum permissible operating nominal pressure pwnp, when the maximum permissible test pressure of 1050 bar [9] is selected

| Fiber material | pwnp EC 406/2010 ISO 19881:2018 | pwnp ISO 11119-3:2020 |
|----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Glass | 1050 / 3.5 = 300 bar | 1050 / 2.4 = 437.5 bar |
| Aramid | 1050 / 3.0 = 350 bar | 1050 / 2.1 = 500 bar |
| Carbon | 1050 / 2.25 = 465 bar | 1050 / 2.0 = 525 bar |

In summary, it can be said that for K2H2, three essential standards could be selected. The three filtered standards cannot be immediately applied to aviation, but provide important indications for K2H2. It was also explained that the working nominal pressure, depending on the considered standard, can be chosen up to a maximum of 525 bar. This restriction is justified by the fact that existing test facilities cannot generate arbitrarily high pressures for experimental evidence.
