=== Importance of Standards <chap_1_0_1>

The development of #gl_("swith",long:true ) represents a significant innovation in aircraft design, combining advanced hydrogen storage with critical structural elements. 
As with any groundbreaking technology, the path from concept to implementation is fraught with challenges. 
This subsection elucidates the critical role that standards play in navigating the challenges of #gl_("swith", pl:true) development and testing. 
It shall be made clear that standards are not only important for the final certification process but also for designing the experimental structural testing environment. 

Standards, at their core, serve as codified best practices and guidelines within a given field. They encapsulate collective knowledge and experience, providing a framework for consistent, safe, and efficient development and implementation of technologies. In fields characterized by innovation and uncertainty, such as #gl_("swith") development, standards take on heightened importance.
Rather than acting as restrictive barriers, standards in innovative contexts serve as foundational reference points. They offer a structured approach to addressing known challenges while providing flexibility for novel solutions. This balance is crucial in the development of #gl_("swith", pl:true), where the integration of high-pressure hydrogen tanks with aircraft wing structures presents unique engineering challenges.

The application of standards in such a novel field offers several advantages. Firstly, it provides a common language and set of expectations among researchers, engineers, and regulators. This shared understanding facilitates more effective collaboration and communication. 
Secondly, standards help in identifying potential risks and challenges early in the development process, allowing for proactive mitigation strategies. 
This is particularly crucial for #gl_("swith", pl:true), where the integration of high-pressure hydrogen storage with critical aircraft structures presents unique safety considerations. 
Lastly they offer a framework for systematic evaluation and validation, crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of innovative technologies like #gl_("swith", pl:true).

While the benefits of applying standards to #gl_("swith", pl:true) development are clear, the process is not without its challenges. 
The primary difficulty lies in the innovative nature of #gl_("swith") itself. 
As an emerging technology, there are no specific standards tailored to its unique characteristics. This absence, however, does not diminish the importance of standards-based approaches. 
Instead, it necessitates a careful and considered application of related standards from adjacent fields.
In the case of #gl_("swith"), relevant adjacent fields include aerospace engineering, hydrogen storage and handling, pressure vessel design, and structural engineering. The task lies in judiciously selecting and adapting these standards to address the specific needs of #gl_("swith") development.

This adaptive approach is particularly crucial in the realm of experimental structural testing. Standards provide guidance on test methodologies, safety protocols, and data collection and analysis procedures. By leveraging these established practices, researchers can ensure that their experimental work on #gl_("swith") is rigorous, repeatable, and aligned with industry expectations.

Moreover, the process of applying and adapting existing standards to #gl_("swith") development could itself contribute to the eventual formulation of #gl_("swith")-specific standards. 
This iterative process of standard application and refinement is a hallmark of technological progress, ensuring that as #gl_("swith", pl:true) mature, so too does the regulatory and standards framework surrounding it. 
In other words, as the technology progresses from concept to prototype to commercial product, standards will need to adapt accordingly. 
For instance, in the early stages of #gl_("swith") development, standards might hypothetically focus on areas such as materials testing and structural analysis. 
Regardless of the initial focus, as #gl_("swith", pl:true) advances, standards may expand to cover areas such as manufacturing processes, maintenance procedures, and operational guidelines for hydrogen-powered aircraft.
Consequently, it can be said that the evolution of standards is likely to play a pivotal role in the maturation of #gl_("swith", pl:true). 


In conclusion, the role of standards in #gl_("swith") development is multifaceted and evolving. While the innovative nature of #gl_("swith", pl:true) present challenges in terms of standard application, these challenges also offer opportunities for advancing both the technology and the regulatory framework surrounding it. 
By carefully adapting existing standards and paving the way for #gl_("swith")-specific standards in the future, researchers and engineers can ensure that #gl_("swith", pl:true) develop and can be structurally valided in a manner that is safe, efficient, and aligned with industry and regulatory expectations.

Standards should be considered as an initial point of reference for the goal of safely desining and conducting a experimental structrual validation tests of #gl_("swith", pl:true) that is meant to be a first step tpwards the certification of #gl_("swith", pl:true).
Standards can be translated as guidelines. For instance, in the field of construction, there would be design guidelines defined by standards. Similarly, for structural testing, there would be safety, procedural, setup, and other guidelines. On one hand, guidelines can be seen as unwanted restrictions. However, they allow systems to function safely and reliably. It can be argued that the use of standards in a field with many unknowns provides a certain level of security and reduces the likelihood of errors. Since both the construction and experimental structural investigation of #gl_("swith", pl:true) are innovations, there are particularly many unknowns in the K2H2 project. This also comes with many potential risks.

It is precisely for this reason that it is necessary, as far as possible, to rely on foundations that allow for safe, clearly traceable, and systematic procedures. Standards offer a kind of guideline that engineers and experts can follow. By adhering to standards, it can largely be ensured that all important aspects are considered. It's also worth noting that standards are usually written and revised by expert groups with a deep understanding of the relevant field. This ensures that factors are considered that an individual might not have thought of.

In addition to ensuring the safety and reliability of products and systems, standards also contribute to compliance with legal regulations. They enable products and systems to meet applicable safety standards and minimize negative consequences for the environment and society. By adhering to standards, new or slightly modified systems can be more easily approved for science and industry.

The introduction should have motivated the search for existing standards for #gl_("swith", pl:true). In summary, it can be said that by using appropriate standards, safety and planned feasibility can be optimized. In addition, the industrial project leader (IMA) can thus offer the developed test concept to third parties as a service more quickly and with comparatively lower cost and time expenditure. However, no #gl_("swith") is known in research or publicly accessible industry. Due to the fact that no #gl_("swith") has been publicly approved to date, at the time of writing this report, there is no standard that fully covers the design and physical structural testing of #gl_("swith", pl:true).


Standards for Wing- Structure- Integrated high-pressure Hydrogen Tanks (SWITHs)
play a vital role in establishing a basis for both design and experimental structural investi-
gation. Particularly when dealing with innovative concepts, fraught with potential risks.
and uncertainties. Recognizing standards as guidelines allows engineers and specialists
to follow a safe, clear, and systematic process. The contribution of experts to the composi-
tion and revision of these standards ensures consideration of aspects that an individual
might not think of, thereby enhancing the safety and reliability of products and systems.

Given that there are standards for both structural testing in aircraft construction and for pure pressure vessels, comparable standards should also be found for the K2H2 project. 

Standards can be translated as guidelines. For instance, in the field of construction, there would be design guidelines defined by standards. Similarly, for structural testing, there would be safety, procedural, setup, and other guidelines. On one hand, guidelines can be seen as unwanted restrictions.

The alternative to a missing comprehensive standard is to break #gl_("swith", pl:true) into sub-areas. The two major sub-areas would be aviation and pressure tank standards. In aviation, distinctions are made according to the approval space, maximum takeoff mass, and the general type of flying object. The approval space refers to the region in which the aircraft is to be approved and operated. There are different approval authorities and regulations depending on which country or region the aircraft is to be approved in. In Europe, for example, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) @EASA_Homepage is responsible for the approval of aircraft, while in the USA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) @FAA_Homepage performs this task. The maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) refers to the maximum weight an aircraft may have to safely take off and fly. Depending on the size and performance of the aircraft, there are different MTOW classes defined in the standards. The general type of flying object refers to the category of the aircraft, such as commercial aircraft, helicopter, small aircraft, and military aircraft.

The present project is being developed for the German market. Therefore, the focus is mainly on European standards. The European Union has established uniform standards for the aviation industry that are binding for all member states. This ensures a uniform basis for the operation of aircraft and safety in air traffic. However, it is known that, for example, American standards do not differ in many areas from European standards. The paragraph numbers are often identical, but details may vary. European aviation standards are referred to as CS (Certification Specifications) @EASA_CS_Genereral. 
The most important CS are CS-23 @EASA_CS_23, CS-25 @EASA_CS_25, CS-27 @EASA_CS_27, and CS-29 @EASA_CS_29. If an aircraft meets the following conditions:

// TODO check if a concrete Amendment must be mentioned here - also general check the value for phd
Category: Normal, Utility, Aerobatic
Maximum takeoff weight: 5670 kg
Maximum number of passengers: 9

CS-23 can be used for certification. With a maximum of 2 propeller drives, CS-23 can be used under the following conditions:

Maximum takeoff weight: 8618 kg
Maximum number of passengers: 19

If one of these criteria is exceeded, either an explicit authorization for use must be obtained from EASA to continue using CS-23 @EASA_CS_23, or a switch to CS-25 @EASA_CS_25 must be made. CS-23 differs from CS-25 essentially in that CS-23 places less demanding requirements on aircraft performance and equipment than CS-25. Another difference is that CS-25 requires a more detailed examination of the aircraft structure, fuel supply, electrical systems, flight control, and other systems. This is because larger aircraft generally have more complex systems and are therefore exposed to higher risks.
Pressure tank standards were mentioned as the second major sub-area. These guidelines cover tanks that contain high-pressure compressed gas. Depending on the pressure range, the chosen gas, the type of storage, the material of the container, and the area of application, specific standards can be found. A more detailed explanation of this will be given in the following section.


In summary, it can be said that within this work, it is not possible to rely exclusively on a single standard. Therefore, existing standards that show visible relevance for #gl_("swith", pl:true) must be found. This is to provide a basis for follow-up work.
