== Standards <chap_1_0>
This section provides a comprehensive overview of the standards relevant to #gl_("swith", pl:true). It begins by examining overarching norms applicable to high-pressure hydrogen systems. 

The fundamentals of pressure vessels are then explored, laying the groundwork for understanding the unique challenges posed by #gl_("swith", pl:true). 
The section proceeds to analyze potentially applicable aerospace standards, highlighting their relevance and limitations. 
It then delves into the preliminary development of structural integral tanks in the automotive industry, offering insights into parallel innovations. 
This is followed by an examination of specific standards from various sectors and a review of relevant patents. The section concludes by identifying and evaluating the most pertinent standards for #gl_("swith", pl:true). Throughout, the text emphasizes the current standardization challenges, the need for new or adapted standards, and the key technical and safety considerations that must be addressed in the development and implementation of #gl_("swith", pl:true).

This section aims to explain why standards for structural integral hydrogen wing tanks #gl_("swith", pl:true) should be considered as an initial point of reference. Subsequently, it will briefly discuss why it's not possible to use a single standard. Finally, the immediate potential solutions will be presented.

Given that there are standards for both structural testing in aircraft construction and for pure pressure vessels, comparable standards should also be found for the K2H2 project. Standards can be translated as guidelines. For instance, in the field of construction, there would be design guidelines defined by standards. Similarly, for structural testing, there would be safety, procedural, setup, and other guidelines. On one hand, guidelines can be seen as unwanted restrictions. However, they allow systems to function safely and reliably. It can be argued that the use of standards in a field with many unknowns provides a certain level of security and reduces the likelihood of errors. Since both the construction and experimental structural investigation of #gl_("swith", pl:true) are innovations, there are particularly many unknowns in the K2H2 project. This also comes with many potential risks.

It is precisely for this reason that it is necessary, as far as possible, to rely on foundations that allow for safe, clearly traceable, and systematic procedures. Standards offer a kind of guideline that engineers and experts can follow. By adhering to standards, it can largely be ensured that all important aspects are considered. It's also worth noting that standards are usually written and revised by expert groups with a deep understanding of the relevant field. This ensures that factors are considered that an individual might not have thought of.

In addition to ensuring the safety and reliability of products and systems, standards also contribute to compliance with legal regulations. They enable products and systems to meet applicable safety standards and minimize negative consequences for the environment and society. By adhering to standards, new or slightly modified systems can be more easily approved for science and industry.

The introduction should have motivated the search for existing standards for #gl_("swith", pl:true). In summary, it can be said that by using appropriate standards, safety and planned feasibility can be optimized. In addition, the industrial project leader (IMA) can thus offer the developed test concept to third parties as a service more quickly and with comparatively lower cost and time expenditure. However, no #gl_("swith") is known in research or publicly accessible industry. Due to the fact that no #gl_("swith") has been publicly approved to date, at the time of writing this report, there is no standard that fully covers the design and physical structural testing of #gl_("swith", pl:true).

The alternative to a missing comprehensive standard is to break #gl_("swith", pl:true) into sub-areas. The two major sub-areas would be aviation and pressure tank standards. In aviation, distinctions are made according to the approval space, maximum takeoff mass, and the general type of flying object. The approval space refers to the region in which the aircraft is to be approved and operated. There are different approval authorities and regulations depending on which country or region the aircraft is to be approved in. In Europe, for example, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is responsible for the approval of aircraft, while in the USA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) performs this task. The maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) refers to the maximum weight an aircraft may have to safely take off and fly. Depending on the size and performance of the aircraft, there are different MTOW classes defined in the standards. The general type of flying object refers to the category of the aircraft, such as commercial aircraft, helicopter, small aircraft, and military aircraft.

The present project is being developed for the German market. Therefore, the focus is mainly on European standards. The European Union has established uniform standards for the aviation industry that are binding for all member states. This ensures a uniform basis for the operation of aircraft and safety in air traffic. However, it is known that, for example, American standards do not differ in many areas from European standards. The paragraph numbers are often identical, but details may vary. European aviation standards are referred to as CS (Certification Specifications). The most important CS are CS-23, CS-25, CS-27, and CS-29. If an aircraft meets the following conditions:

Category: Normal, Utility, Aerobatic
Maximum takeoff weight: 5670 kg
Maximum number of passengers: 9

CS-23 can be used for certification. With a maximum of 2 propeller drives, CS-23 can be used under the following conditions:

Maximum takeoff weight: 8618 kg
Maximum number of passengers: 19

If one of these criteria is exceeded, either an explicit authorization for use must be obtained from EASA to continue using CS-23, or a switch to CS-25 must be made. CS-23 differs from CS-25 essentially in that CS-23 places less demanding requirements on aircraft performance and equipment than CS-25. Another difference is that CS-25 requires a more detailed examination of the aircraft structure, fuel supply, electrical systems, flight control, and other systems. This is because larger aircraft generally have more complex systems and are therefore exposed to higher risks.
Pressure tank standards were mentioned as the second major sub-area. These guidelines cover tanks that contain high-pressure compressed gas. Depending on the pressure range, the chosen gas, the type of storage, the material of the container, and the area of application, specific standards can be found. A more detailed explanation of this will be given in the following section.


In summary, it can be said that within this work, it is not possible to rely exclusively on a single standard. Therefore, existing standards that show visible relevance for #gl_("swith", pl:true) must be found. This is to provide a basis for follow-up work.
