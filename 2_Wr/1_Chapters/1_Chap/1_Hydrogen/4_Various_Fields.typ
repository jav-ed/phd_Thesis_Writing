=== II.6 Specific Standards from Various Fields

In the section "Preliminary Development of a Structural Integral Tank from Automotive Engineering," it was already explained that the automotive industry is ahead of aviation in some areas and pursues similar goals as aviation in some areas. Due to similar thought processes, the search was extended to other branches. Therefore, in the following, some important standards from other areas that use high-pressure tanks as a power source will be specified. In addition to these, standards for tanks in mobile applications, independent of a specific branch, will also be mentioned. Furthermore, ISO standards dealing with hydrogen applications will be named.

The automotive industry generally includes cars (motor vehicles), buses, and heavy goods transporters (trucks). Examples of other industrial sectors for which the use of hydrogen as a future energy source is conceivable are listed in Table 10. It is important to note that some of these industries are actively conducting research to realize hydrogen propulsion. The motivation is the same as in aviation. The mobility and transport economic sectors are of central importance for the economy and private households. The average consumer is actively involved in burdening the environment through daily use of cars, ordering goods, etc. As these industries are heavily used, correspondingly high environmental damage occurs.

Table 10: Hydrogen as an energy source for propulsion of potential industries besides aviation

1. Small to large ships,
2. Boats,
3. Motorcycles,
4. Trains (Alstom),
5. Quadrocopters or similar small aircraft variations,
6. Innovative flying taxis for individuals and families.

A significant difference between aviation, automobile, and motorcycle construction lies in the placement of the pressure vessels. While motor vehicles operate on the ground and are thus not exposed to any large pressure difference, aircraft and other aircraft must be designed for different flight altitudes. This results in high pressure differences, which leads to higher loads in the structural design. Rail vehicles, on the one hand, do not have the mentioned problem of pressure difference. On the other hand, it can be claimed that trains generally have more freely available space than aircraft. Aviation is an area strongly dominated by lightweight construction. The structure should be as light as possible while fulfilling all structural requirements with safety factors. In addition, the space should be ideally utilized so that the economic yield can be optimized by taking as many passengers and/or cargo as possible. Quadrocopters and innovative flying taxis are still too far from implementation to be comparable with functional and long-tested technologies.

For the mobile use of hydrogen-powered means of transport, a significant distinction can be made: is it a light or heavy mobility solution. Table 11 provides an overview of some of the found standards and projects that deal with compressed hydrogen as fuel for the light mobile sector. Comparables for heavy means of transportation, pressure cylinders in general without a clearly defined case for mobile application, and near-ground static pressure storage standards are given in Tables 12 - 14. Before further statements are made about the already mentioned standards, the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standards, which deal exclusively with hydrogen, should be listed in Table 15.

[Tables 11-15 with various standards are included here]

It can be summarized that there are various different areas that want to use hydrogen as a sustainable energy source. In some of these areas, there are only ideas, while others can already show initial concepts up to functional prototypes. Still others are already selling their technology commercially and have already received official approval. The more advanced industries have specific requirements that differ from aviation. Therefore, it is currently not possible to transfer existing concepts one-to-one to K2H2.
