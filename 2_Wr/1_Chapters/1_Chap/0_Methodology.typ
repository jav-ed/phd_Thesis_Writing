= Methodology <chap_1>
In this chapter the current state of certification of #gl_("swith", long:true) shall be explained in detail in
//
//TODO
// @chap_1_0
.
For this purpose it is inially important to understand why standards are of importance for this regard. Next, a detailed research of available standards is outlined followed by an systematic assesetment wich standards could be used for a potential commerical certification of #gl_("swith", pl:true).

Once standards that could be useful for #gl_("swith", pl:true) are systematically filtered, the next step towards a possible experimental strucutral verfication can be taken. 
For this, the way of important and suitable loadcases is explained as well as the actual found load cases outlined properly.

With the knowledge of a desired loadcase that shall be used for a potential experimental sutrucre validation test, a fundamental question shall be answered in
//
//TODO
// @chap_1_0
.
Namely, for the experimntal test, can the filling agent be replaced with somehting else than water?
Having answered this question, methods for physically introducing a load into a #gl_("swith") is layed out in detail in 
//
//TODO
// @chap_1_0
.
Finally it can be explained how optimization can be leveraged to get infromaiton that are requierd for a real-world experimental strucutre validation test.
The results of the optimization and the probabale variations that could be encountered in real-world are covered in 
//
//TODO
// @chap_2_0
.
