// TODO Title
== Loadcase <chap_3_0>

// what was done in the previous chapters, standrds - infromation allow to use different filling agents
// hydrogen sections showed hydrogen very nice still has hazards
// swiths compared to apus have high length for the tubes nd hihg pressure --> propsed a pathway
// currently technolgioy advancements not far enough.
// since current applicaiton of hydrogen is not feasible from the safety aspect ->  investigations wheeter other filling agents could be used without them having an impact on the structre properties during the experimental structree test.
// However, before doing any research on this topic, it is important to provide infromation about which laod cases are the most improtant when it comes to the structral validaiton ceritifcation of regular aircraft.
// this is done in @sec

// once the loadcase was deifned the ivnesgitaiotn on wheter the filling agent has an impact on the strucal properties is done in suibsection @

=== Most prominent laodcases 

// VN-Diag


=== Curvature Study
