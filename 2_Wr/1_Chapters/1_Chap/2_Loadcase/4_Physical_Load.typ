=== Physical Load Application<chap_3_0_4>

Critical load case found identified, proper infromaiton about hydrogen properties. focused on the hazard properties of hydrogen.
Decided wehter based on the given technical advantages it is feasible to conduct a experimental structral validation test with hydrogen
Found a method how to assess whter hydrogen could be replaced througha nother filling agent without chaning important structral properties.

There are many advatages of numeircal simualtion over experiemntal investigatosn. One could be noted for fem simulations in @chap_3_0_3 and @chap_3_0_4. Chaning simulation parameter like the internal pressure do not require much effort. Addtionaly applying loads into the simulaiton model already has its theoretical background covered. However, for experimental investigations, mehtod to securely and accurately apply loads into the wings through physical objects is required.
Thus, this section has the focus on first generally presenting methods tht can be utilized to apply physical into a #gls("swith", long:true). 
The found options shall be explained briefly, mentioning advantage and disadvantge.
for clear reading table presentatoion shall be given.
The output of this section is important for the upcoming optimization
