= Abstract

This thesis investigates #glspl("swith", long:true) as an innovative approach to sustainable aviation. The integration of hydrogen fuel tanks into wing structures represents a significant departure from conventional aircraft design, offering potential benefits in both fuel storage efficiency and structural performance. However, no operational #glspl("swith") currently exist in commercial aviation, and the field lacks established standards and regulatory frameworks.
This research advances the development of static testing methodologies for #glspl("swith"), addressing critical challenges in their certification pathway.
Through comprehensive analysis of existing standards and pressure vessel technology, Type IV vessels were identified as the most suitable configuration. Current test facility limitations establish maximum allowable nominal pressure ranges between 437.5 and $525 "bar"$. 
Due to safety considerations with hydrogen handling, the study developed a curvature-based approach to assess whether alternative filling agents could be used during experimental testing without significantly affecting the structural properties.

The thesis introduces an optimization framework for #glspl("lie", long:true) to discretize aerodynamic loads, providing crucial insights into their configuration, quantity, dimensions, and force application. 
This framework advances understanding of practical implementation challenges in #gls("swith") testing.
This dissertation, being the first doctoral thesis dedicated to #glspl("swith"), establishes a foundation for future research. 
Key recommendations for #glspl("swith") progression include developing comprehensive certification standards and creating open-source #gls("fem", long:true) models. 
Essential to these advancements, a pathway was proposed combining experimental testing and numerical simulations to enable safe hydrogen-based structural validation at large aircraft scale.
The findings contribute to the broader goal of sustainable aviation while highlighting critical pathways for further technical advancement in aircraft design.
