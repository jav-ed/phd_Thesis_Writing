= Abstract

This thesis, being the first doctoral dissertation dedicated to #glspl("swith"), investigates #gls("swith") as an innovative approach to sustainable aviation.
The integration of hydrogen fuel tanks into wing structures represents a substantial departure from conventional aircraft design, offering benefits in both fuel storage efficiency and structural performance. 
However, no operational #glspl("swith") currently exist in commercial aviation.
This research advances the development of static testing methodologies for #glspl("swith"), addressing critical challenges in their certification pathway.

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
Through in-depth analysis of existing standards across aviation, pressure vessel applications, and hydrogen systems, no single standard exists for #gls("swith") certification, leading to the synthesis of state-of-the-art alternatives based on defined assessment criteria.
Through extensive review of hydrogen tank applications across diverse mobility sectors, considering cost-effectiveness and safety requirements, Type IV vessels emerged as the most suitable pressure vessel for #glspl("swith"). A key finding revealed that current test facility limitations constrain maximum allowable nominal pressure ranges between $437.5 "bar"$ and $525 "bar"$.

Comprehensive theoretical studies and experimental investigations identified major barriers to conducting structural tests with hydrogen as the filling medium, further complicated by current technological maturity.
To overcome these obstacles, a pathway was proposed that combines incremental experimental testing and numerical simulations to enable safe hydrogen-based structural validation at large aircraft scale.
The presented critical load derivation, a fundamental aspect of structural testing, yields benefits for both #gls("swith") and regular aircraft.
To assess whether alternative filling agents could be used during experimental testing without significantly affecting the structural properties, a curvature-based method was developed and explained in detail.
The dissertation provides an in-depth analysis of #glspl("lie", long:true) for introducing physical loads into the wing, along with an initial aerodynamic #gls("ld", long:true) strategy. 
To have more control over the #gls("ld"), essential for experimental tests, an efficient optimization framework is developed. This framework offers crucial insights into the configuration, quantity, dimensions, and force application of #glspl("lie", long:true).
