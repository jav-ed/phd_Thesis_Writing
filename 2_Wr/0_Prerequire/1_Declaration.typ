= Declaration of Independent Authorship

I hereby declare that the present work, the doctoral thesis, is solely and independently done by myself in all aspects, such as developments, code implementations, and writing of the thesis.


I would like to acknowledge that I leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) through #glspl("llm") for writing assistance. 
In particular, they were used for English language refinements, such as grammar and spelling checks, and, on occasion, for verifying sentence comprehensibility. The latter was done by having the #glspl("llm") evaluate whether complex sentences remained understandable to readers.

Following the declaration of independent work, and addressing the matter of ethical integrity, I, Javed Arshad Butt, choose to make my commitment to scientific standards in a way that reflects my identity.

To the best of my knowledge and understanding, I inshallah have adhered to proper academic writing standards and research ethics throughout this doctoral thesis, ensuring all sources are appropriately acknowledged and all work is presented with scientific integrity.

I confirm that I did not use any tools, materials or sources other than those explicitly specified.
