Thanks belong to the *ONE* Who does not need my thanks.

Appreciation belongs to the *ONE* Who does not need my appreciation.

Praise belongs to the *ONE* Who does not need my praise.


#v(1em)
The *ONE* Who needs nothing from me, but on Whom i am dependent in every aspect of my life. This life and especially the next one.

#v(1em)
He was there before i existed,

He was there when i knew nothing,

He was there when i started to think i would know something,

He is there whenever i need Him,

He is there whenever i think about Him,

He is there when i will die, and

He is there when the final day arrives.

#v(1em)

He gave my life a purpose and if He helps me, i might achieve a bit of it.
May He help me to prove that my life, my belongings, and my loyalty belong to Him and accept it from me. May He forgive me.

#v(1.5em)
The desire is to get:
#v(-1em)
#table(

    [1 - His forgiveness, ],

    [5 - good news from Him.],
    [2 - His guidance, ],

Professor Johannes Markmiller, thank you for that decisive job interview. 
Your warm and approachable personality convinced me to accept the position at your Chair of Aircraft Engineering, even though the research topic seemed rather unexciting at first. 
Having worked with you over these years, I would like to highlight one special aspect: I truly enjoyed our conversations. Our meetings often extended well beyond their planned duration. It was especially enriching that we could explore various topics, not solely those related to science. You possess the rare ability to present complex differential equations with remarkable clarity. One quality that particularly impressed me was your skill in making me feel respected throughout our interactions.

#v(1em)
Next, I would like to thank Dr.-Ing. Florian Dexl. Your research paper about multidisciplinary optimization was one of the reasons why I applied at the TUD Dresden University of Technology in the first place. 
It turned out that you would become the supervisor of the small engineering working group. A standout experience I remember is how enjoyable it was to solve analytical equations with you.
Thank you also for conducting the perfume study with me.


#v(1em)
I would like to thank Dr.-Ing. Silvio Nebel, Head of Department Aerospace at IMA Materialforschung und Anwendungstechnik GmbH Dresden, for sharing valuable experience through monthly meetings. His and IMA's contributions were pivotal for the project K#sub[2]H#sub[2] as mentioned in @chap_0_6.

Next, I would like to acknowledge is something that highly concerned me. So much so that, during that time, I could not have cared less about the research on #glspl("swith", long:true).
I felt ashamed - ashamed of myself, of what I had achieved, of my current situation. I felt weak and questioned my life's decisions. People were being bombed - elderly, men, women, children, and even newborns. I was unable to do anything to help them.
At the time of writing this thesis, I lived in Dresden, Germany. 
During this period, while Israel was bombing Palestine, leading German politicians publicly declared that the German nation would stand with Israel.
Dear reader, I ask you to recognize my utmost desire to distance myself as much as possible from the actions taken by leading German politicians in the years 2023 and 2024.

While this short paragraph does not permit space for detailed elaborations, I would like to pinpoint a few crucial points.
I am saying this as a non-Arab - I was not born in Palestine, I never went there, from what I know I also do not have any family members there, nor do I have any connections to people there.
Taking away drinking water from any population, be it a Muslim Arab or whoever else, can easily be seen as a monstrous act. I know that every human was gifted with dignity, honor and respect.
Part of this dignity is unrestricted access to water. Another important element of human dignity are human rights - all of them.
 
Many more examples could be given, highlighting simple and ubiquitously ethical aspects. Beyond my personal observations, even politically constrained academia can be consulted @Jones2024 @Kunichoff2024 @El_Shewy2024 @Brooks2024 @Ram2024 @Khafaei2024 @neier2024israel @Segal2024 @Abuawad2024 @link_UN_3.
Most of them are very clear in their arguments, such as:

#quote(attribution: [Duality and dual use in Israel's war on Gaza|\ Craig Jones, Ichamati Mousamputri, Mark Griffiths @Jones2024])[
In this militarised vision of Gaza and Gazans, everything can be targeted or prohibited, everyone is culpable and killable. Hospitals are military stores, construction materials are bomb components, and civilians are combatants. Almost nothing exists outside of this logic, and thus almost everything is destroyable, from people and their homes to the medicines and food that sustain life. This has been the case since the beginning of the 2007 siege and has intensified as part of the military assaults that have followed the 7 October Hamas attacks.]


#quote(attribution: [Beyond Apartheid Israel|\ Andrew Brooks, Mark Griffiths @Brooks2024])[
Israel's war on Gaza is genocidal @albanese2024anatomy, and the dimensions of the colonial violence inflicted therein expand well beyond the parameters of apartheid. 
]

Institutions like Amnesty International @link_Amnesty_0 @link_Amnesty_1, the United Nations (UN)
@link_UN_0 @link_UN_1 @link_UN_2 @link_UN_3, and the 
International Criminal Court (ICC) @link_ICC_0, while being under political pressure, are also not quiet about the genocide conducted by Israel against the humans in Palestine.

Being well aware of global politics, I understand that opposing the stance of leading German and US politicians could have serious consequences for both my personal life and this thesis.
Yet, I believe standing up for justice is worth taking such risks.
This stance also demonstrates to Whom my loyalty belongs - the *ONE*.

During this period, another situation that deeply distressed me was the imprisonment of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and beloved journalist and freedom advocate Imran Riaz Khan.


Finally, to show one beautiful aspect of Germany, I would like to express my gratitude to the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action of Germany. It has sponsored this research as properly acknowledged in @chap_0_6.
