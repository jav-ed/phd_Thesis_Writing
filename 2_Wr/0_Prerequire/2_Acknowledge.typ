Prof. Johannes Markmiller, thank you a lot for that job interview. It was your sympatehtic appearnce that convinces me to work as a scientists at your chair of Aircraft Engineering. The topic really sounded quite boring. 
Having worked with you the upcoming years, I want to hihglight one special point, I really enjoyed the conversations with you. 
Usally, our conversations took much more time than initally planed. 
Also, it was very nice that we could talk about all kind of topics, not only science related. 
You are a man that knows how to present complex differential equations as they would be easy. 
One thing you imprssied me with was you skill to let the person in front of you feel respected.

#v(1em)
Next, I would like to thank you Dr.-Ing. Florian Dexl. You were the reason why I applied at the Technische Universit√§t Dresden in the first place. It turned out that you would become the leader of our small engineers working groups. One special occusion I would like to mention is that, I still remember how joyful I found it to solve some analytical equaitons with you.  
Beides the scientific aspect, i enjoyed our conversations about other topics. Also thank you for conducting the parfume study with me.
All in all I want to express my gratitude and apprecitation for your ideas and time.  

#v(1em)
Dr.-Ing. Silvio Nebel is the Head of Department Aerospace of IMA Dresden. Thank you for sharing your experience through the monthly held meetings. Your and IMA's contirbutions are pivotal for the project K#sub[2]H#sub[2] as mentioned in @chap_0_6 and conclusively for this doctoral thesis.

The next i would to acknowledge is that highly concerned me. So much so that back in that time, I could have not cared less about the reserach on #glspl("swith", long:true).
I felt ashmed of me, of what i acheived, of my current situation, I just felt weak and put my life's decision under question.
People were bombed, elderlies, men, females, children and even new borns.
I was not able to do anything to help them.
Coming to today, when I was writing this thesis, I used to live in Dresden in Germany. 
In this time while Israel was bombing Palestine, leading plotican would publicy decalre Hamas as terrorists and say that the german nation would stand for Israel.
Dear reader, I would like to ask you accept my apeal to distance me as much as possible from the actions conducted by the leading germans poltications in the year of 2023 and 2024.

While, I cannot talk in much detail about this issue within this short paragraph, I would like pinpoint few crucial points.
I am saying this as a non arab - I was not born in Palestine, I never went there, from what I know I also do not have any family member there, and I do not have any connections to people there.
Taking away drinking water from any population, being it a muslim arab or whoever else can easily be seen as a monstreous act. I know that every human was gifted with dignity, honor and respect.
Part of this dignity is unrestrcited access to water. Another important aspect of human diginity are human rights - all of them.

A lot more instances could be given, highlighting simple simple and ubiquitously ethic aspects, however, even poltical constrainted academia can be consulted

Most of them are very clear in their arguments, such as:

#quote(attribution: [Duality and dual use in Israel's war on Gaza|\ Craig Jones, Ichamati Mousamputri, Mark Griffiths @Jones2024])[
In this militarised vision of Gaza and Gazans, everything can be targeted or prohibited, everyone is culpable and killable. Hospitals are military stores, construction materials are bomb components, and civilians are combatants. Almost nothing exists outside of this logic, and thus almost everything is destroyable, from people and their homes to the medicines and food that sustain life. This has been the case since the beginning of the 2007 siege and has intensified as part of the military assaults that have followed the 7 October Hamas attacks.]


#quote(attribution: [Beyond Apartheid Israel|\ Andrew Brooks, Mark Griffiths @Brooks2024])[
Israel's war on Gaza is genocidal @albanese2024anatomy, and the dimensions of the colonial violence inflicted therein expand well beyond the parameters of apartheid. 
]


Instituations like Amnestiy International @link_Amnesty_0 @link_Amnesty_1, the Unitied Nations
@link_UN_0 @link_UN_1 @link_UN_2 @link_UN_3, and the 
International Criminal Court (ICC) @link_ICC_0 while being under poltical pressure are also not quite about the genocide conducted by Israel against the humans in Palestine.
 
I know enough about global poltics to know that publicaly stating  things that are against the desire of leading politicans in germany could  have big negative concequnecies for my life and this thesis.
Yet, i think that it is important that people take risks to stand up for justice.
The latter is also supposed to show to Whom my loyailty belongs - the *ONE*.

Finally, to show one beautoful aspect of Germany, I would like to express my gratitude to the the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action of Germany. It has sponsored this research as properly acknowledged in @chap_0_6.
