Thanks belongs to the *ONE* Who does not need my thanks.

Appreciation belongs to the *ONE* Who does not my appreciation.

Praise belongs to the *ONE* Who does not need my praise.

The *ONE* Who needs nothing from me, but on Whom Ii am depended on every aspect of my live. This live, but espeically the next one.

He was there before i existed, He was there when i knew nothing, He was there when i started to think i would know somehting, He is there in the darkest hours of my life, He is there when i will die and He is there when the final day arrives.

He gave my life a prupose, taught me how to distinguish beteen whats right and whats wrong. Clearly the blind and the seeing one are not the same.
He  the *ONE* Who 

He knows when i am feeling pain, when no one else knows about it. He is the first one i am talking to whenever i need help. This might be small things like not finding my mobile phone or big life changing decisions, like what inshallah to do with the rest of the years i have.

The desire is to get His forgiveness, His guidance, His rahma ($~$ mercy), His contentment and good news from Him.

You can call Him how you like, the most beautiful names are His.
