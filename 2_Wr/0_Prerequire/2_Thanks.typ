Thanks belongs to the *ONE* Who does not need my thanks.

Appreciation belongs to the *ONE* Who does not my appreciation.

Praise belongs to the *ONE* Who does not need my praise.

The *ONE* Who needs nothing from me, but on Whom i am depended on every aspect of my live. This live and espeically the next one.

He was there before i existed, He was there when i knew nothing, He was there when i started to think i would know somehting, 
// this is not that well expressed
He is there in the darkest hours of my life, He is there whenever anyone calls for Him, He is there when i will die and He is there when the final day arrives.

He gave my life a prupose and if He helps me, I might achieve a bit of it.

May he help me to prove that my life, my belongings and my loylaity belongs to Him and accept it from me. May He forgive me

The desire is to get His forgiveness, His guidance, His rahma ($~$ mercy), His contentment and good news from Him.

you can call Him how you like, the most beautiful names are His.

Prof. Johannes Markmiller, thank you a lot for that Interview. It was your sympatehtic appearnce that convinces me to work as a scientists at your Chair of Aircraft Engineering. The topic really sounded quite boring. 
Having worked with you the upcoming years, I want to hihglight one special point, I really enjoyed the conversations with you. 
Usally, our conversations took much more time than initally planed. 
Also, it was very nice that we could talk about all kind of topics, not only science related. 
You are a man that knows how to present complex differential equations as they would be easy and one thing in which you are amazingly skiiled: you know how to let the person in front of you feel respected.

Next, I would like to thank you Dr.-Ing. Florian Dexl. You were the reason why I applied at the Technische Universit√§t Dresden in the first place. It turned out that you would become the leader of our small engineers working groups. One special occusion I would like to mention is that, I still remember how joyful I found it to solve some analytical equaitons with you. Beides the scientific aspect, i enjoyed our conversations about other topics. Also thank you for conducting the parfume study with me.
All in all I want to express my gratitude and apprecitation for your ideas and time.
